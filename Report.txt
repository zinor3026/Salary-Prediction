Report on the Random Forest Regression Model


Overview:
The main objective is to creat a salary prediction model and answer the question; What should be my salary expectations depending on my skills, job title and company I am working at.

Results:


Data Preprocessing:


What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
- The variable "avg_salary" which shows the average salary is our target.
What variable(s) are the features for your model?
- The variables 'Company_Name','Job_Title','Type_of_Ownership','Sector','Size','python_yn','R_yn','spark','aws','excel', and'Rating' are the features.


Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model :

- To create the random forest regression model, I used 500 n estimators.

- I achieved an Mean Absolute Percentage Error: 33.024572518949654% which is less than 35%. Mean Absolute Percentage Error shows how far off the predictions were in terms of percentages.

- To increase the model performance, we used hyperparameter tuning; Hyperparameter tuning is the process of optimizing the hyperparameters of a machine learning model to improve its performance. 




Summary:


Looking at the summary of the model, we have
Mean Squared Error: 1123.893330597165
Root Mean Squared Error: 33.524518349965376
Mean Absolute Percentage Error: 33.024572518949654%


The different models I used were, Neural Network and Linear Regression to test if they fit better than random forest regression model. But both performed worse than the random forest.
